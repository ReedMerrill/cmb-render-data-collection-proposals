description,"For the project ""They Got a Ticket to Run: Navigating Ballot Access for Local Canadian Politicians"", I propose a survey module to determine which institutional barriers candidates face, how these barriers impact their access to the ballot, and how these barriers impact candidates across provinces and municipalities. 



Three factors influence a citizen’s decision to run for office: personal, contextual, and legal. The personal characteristics refer to notions of substantive and descriptive representation, as well as other personal determinants of aspiring candidates. For instance, women are less likely to run for election, and less likely to see themselves as qualified enough to run, unless they see more women run for office. Contextual factors include, but are not limited to, incumbent effects, which may discourage or encourage potential candidates to run for office. Legal factors refer to government institutions, and rules which candidates running for office are subjected to. These factors can influence turnout and the candidate pool. 



To fully understand turnout and candidate pools we must consider the ballot access process for local candidates (legal factor). This project will allow us to consider the role played by institutions in the process of becoming a municipal election candidate in Canada. This project focuses on the legal/institutional factors and asks: how do ballot access procedures encourage and deter municipal election candidates to run for office? Which candidates are affected? Why?  Which jurisdictions are affected? Why?

contribution,"The contribution of this project is multifaceted. First, it considers the institutionnal hurdles (ballot access) faced by all elites in the sample in their path to elected office. Second, it will determine which institutional (legal) factors facilitate and/or hinder access to elected office (ballot access) across age, gender, province, and municipality type. The results will enable us to submit policy briefs to all interested jurisdictions (municipalities/provinces), specifically those aiming to diversify their candidate pools, or simplify or streamline their nomination processes, helping them achieve their goals with clear evidence of what works and what does not. Finally, the project will contribute to the broader literature on institutional barriers, offering insight into how governments can enhance and diversify their candidate pools."
audience,"Policy makers, politically inclined citizens, election governing bodies, and academics."
