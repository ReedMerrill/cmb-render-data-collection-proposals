description,"Recent research has argued that Canadian municipal politics and municipal policy attitudes are strongly structured by left-right ideology. Yet many local policy issues also create “strange bedfellows” – coalitions in which local residents ally with their neighbours across ideological lines to oppose local developments (which some may support in the abstract but oppose locally) or support new infrastructure and services (which some might oppose in the abstract but support locally). When municipal policy initiatives are spatially divisible – ie, they can be targeted towards individual properties or specific neighbourhoods – residents have an interest in maximizing the allocation of perceived ‘goods’ (‘desirable’ amenities, services, and property uses from their perspective) and minimizing the allocation of perceived ‘bads’ (undesirable amenities, services and uses). These allocational interests may, and in some cases clearly do, moderate the ideologically-informed policy attitudes of residents when it comes to neighbourhood-level allocational policy decisions. 

Our goal in this research is to investigate how allocational interests moderate the ideological structure of public attitudes towards municipal policy issues. We are calling these ‘allocational effects’ on policy attitudes. Specifically, we are interested in exploring: 1. Whether and how the strength allocational effects varies by issue area; 2. Whether allocational effects are similar for allocational ‘goods’ and ‘bads’; and 3. Whether allocational effects operate similarly or differently for individuals who identify as right-wing and left-wing. Tentative hypotheses, derived in part from findings in existing literature, include the following: 1. The strength of allocational effects will vary with issue salience; 2. Allocational effects will be stronger for perceived ‘bads’ than for perceived ‘goods’; 3. Allocational effects will be ideologically structured – effects for left-wing individuals will be stronger in the case of perceived ‘bads’; effects for right-wing individuals will be stronger in the case of perceived ‘goods’. 

Taking advantage of the large sample size in the public survey, our method involves a survey experiment with topic sampling (Clifford and Rainey 2024, Clifford et al. 2024). We have generated 40   pairs of issue statements on a range of spatially municipal policy issues, from likely neighbourhood ‘goods’ to likely neighbourhood ‘bads’. In each case, we vary the framing of the issue statement between a general framing and a neighbourhood-specific framing (see below). Each respondent will answer six issue questions  , randomly assigned. In order to avoid spillover effects, any one respondent will receive only generally-framed or only neighborhood-framed statements. Given the different scope of municipal government in small communities, as well as differences in the logic of spatial allocation in rural and small-town contexts, we will filter out respondents who live in small towns or rural areas   (see below). This will likely drop about 15% of the overall sample of 6500; assuming another 15% ‘don’t know’ responses, our actual sample will be about 5,000, resulting in 30,000 responses overall, or about 500 per issue statement (or 1,000 per pair of statements).
"
contribution,"While there has been a significant amount of work recently on the politics of NIMBYism, including at least one publication (Hankinson 2018) that uses a survey experiment with varied scalar framing, our broader understanding of the local politics of spatial allocation is not well developed, and we are not aware of any work that addresses the relationship between ideology and allocational interests. Our results will advance our theoretical understanding of the factors that structure local policy attitudes. Building on Lucas’ (2024) recent work on ideology in municipal politics, it will give us new insight into how (and under what conditions) allocational interests shape policy attitudes in a manner that is orthogonal to the structuring impact of ideology."
audience,"Our primary audience is academic scholars of local government and politics, as well as scholars who study policy fields that are strongly impacted by allocational preference dynamics (such as housing and transport). Our work will have scholarly relevance beyond the Canadian context, in particular in the US, where the institutional structure of local government gives significant power to hyper-local allocational interests, as in Canada (Einstein, Glick and Palmer 2020). In addition, we expect our work to be of interest to local policy-makers and politicians. Neighbourhood opposition to new development of many kinds presents fundamental challenges to effective local policy implementation in Canada and beyond, and our work will shed new light on the structure of that opposition."
outputs,"We plan to submit our results to a general urban studies journal, such as Nature Cities, Cities, and Urban Studies. If this is unsuccessful we will try Urban Affairs Review and/or Journal of Urban Affairs."
outputs_kmb,"After academic publication, we will write an engaging summary of our results in Conversation Canada or on IRPP, and cross-post it on the CMB website."

1.	Approximately how many years have lived in your current neighbourhood?  [We are interested in neighbourhood-level allocational effects, so we prefer this wording; however, the working could be changed to ‘in your current residence’ if that’s more useful for other projects. We could also have both variants on the survey if there’s room].

2.	Which of the following terms best describes the place in which you live? Response: options: urban, suburban, small town, and rural.

3.	Issue statement questions. There are 40 pairs of statements (80 in total). Each respondent will receive either six general-frame statements or six neighbourhood-frame statements, randomly assigned. The answer categories will be:

strongly agree; somewhat agree; somewhat disagree; strongly disagree; don’t know

Here are draft versions of our statement pairs. We place to do some more work to vary the tradeoff presentation in these statements before finalizing:
