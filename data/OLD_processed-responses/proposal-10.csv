description,"Politicians' implicit theories of voting behaviour play an important role in elections. If politicians are even remotely election-oriented, they are likely to focus special attention on communicating with and understanding the preferences of municipal voters, and even if a politician is entirely policy-seeking and unconcerned with re-election, politicians' understanding of who votes in local elections and who their personal supporters are may still shape how they communicate with the general public. How politicians choose to act as representatives and candidates is profoundly shaped by their beliefs about voting behaviour, yet we currently understand very little about these beliefs. This study will use a conjoint experiment to examine politicians' implicit theories of municipal voter turnout and voting behaviour. 
"
contribution,"We have a good amount of aggregate information about politicians' implicit theories and perceptual accuracy, but this study will allow for more fine-grained analysis: we'll be able to see how politicians think about specific kinds of constituents."
