description,"Over the last decade, concepts of reconciliation have been consistently brought forth in discussions relating to not only Canadian/Indigenous relations, but also to Indigenous relations with different levels of government within the Canadian state. While much focus seems to be on the federal and provincial governments, there has also been movement amongst municipalities. In turn, questions relating to what municipalities may be seeking to do, and to what extent, alongside relationship building with Indigenous nations, communities, and peoples is an area of research that is dynamic and warrants further research.

There are multiple reasons to consider such research, including an assessment of policy implementation, nation-to-nation relationship building, best practices, as well as for understanding regional approaches and differences in approach based on the size of a municipality and possibly also depending on the Indigenous nation or population with which that municipality is engaged.  Existing research has begun to document municipal initiatives to build better relationships with Indigenous nations and urban populations (See work by Anderson and Flynn; Heritz; Spicer for instance) as well as documented a proliferation of intergovernmental agreement between municipalities and adjacent Indigenous communities (Alcantara and Nelles 2012).  By documenting such initiatives at a scale possible with the CMB survey, the literature on nation-to-nation relations and reconciliation would grow substantially by considering another entire level of governance within the Canadian state in a comprehensive way that is only possible with this kind of large-scale survey data collection. 

Anderson and Flynn (2021) lay some groundwork on such discussions. An assessment of forms of Indigenous/Municipal relations are explored – with special attention given to the initiatives put forth by the cities of Vancouver, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, and Halifax. As highlighted by Anderson and Flynn, each of the aforementioned cities have established a specific office or position to further assess and implement initiatives in relation to Indigenous relations and peoples (16-18). Additionally, each city has committed themselves to the TRC recommendations that were outlined in 2015 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (16-18). Additionally, each city has agreed to move further in recognizing and discussing Indigenous histories in relation to the areas each city is built upon (16-18). To what extent such agreements and initiatives have been properly implemented and included Indigenous input are a couple of components to still consider. Additionally, what other municipalities (big or small) are doing, or considering, is also something of importance to assess – items which this research hopes to include and assess.
"
contribution,"The novelty of our approach is that we will collect a large-scale data set of municipalities of a variety of sizes to ascertain the extent to which initiatives to build new relationships with Indigenous nations and urban Indigenous communities and populations in large urban centers have been undertaken elsewhere.  Alcantara and Nelles (2016) have found that the number of intergovernmental agreements between First Nations and municipalities has increased since 2000 but data on the range of municipal initiatives and policies that have been undertaken and enacted (beyond intergovernmental agreements) is currently unavailable. 

This work is situated within and has the support of the multilevel governance pillar, because municipal-Indigenous relations is properly conceived as a question of the interaction among different governmental authorities - and not as a question of policy (although municipalities certainly make policies that are relevant to their relationship with Indigenous communities and therefore may be of interest to the public policy pillar). Thus, with the multilevel governance pillar’s support we propose to collect survey data to answer the initial questions listed below which we hope will ignite further research on this topic in our pillar.   By documenting municipal efforts to engage with Indigenous nations, communities and urban communities, our research will assist with not only nation-to-nation relations and reconciliation but also contribute to our understanding of two of the CMB questions listed previously: 1) How does local engagement and representation vary across places in Canada? What accounts for this variation, and what can we learn from it to improve local democracy?; 2) How do local government institutions strengthen or weaken turnout, engagement, and representation in Canada? What major or minor reforms might improve local democracy?

"
sample_pol,"The purpose of this survey is to survey all municipal politicians, and employees where possible, because this project is an initial scoping exercise to gauge the level of activity in Municipal-Indigenous relations and to assess municipal efforts to contribute to reconciliation."
pew_pol,The estimate of the Pew Points for such a survey put forth in this proposal reflect between 22.68 - 28.68. The difference in range of six Pew Points specifically reflects the ‘other’ categories of two of the proposed questions.
